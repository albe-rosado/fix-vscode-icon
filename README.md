## Installation & Usage: 
I got tired of googling for a solution to fix the Visual Studio Code missing icon after every update in Ubuntu Gnome with Numix icons theme, so I made a simple script to fix this problem. 
```bash 
# Download or clone the repo 
git clone https://github.com/albe-rosado/fix-vscode-icon.git 
# Run the script with sudo privilegies 
sudo bash fix_vscode_icon.sh 
``` 
If you are using Gnome , you have to press ``` Alt + F2 ``` type ``` r ``` in the little window and hit ``` Enter ``` to apply the changes. Good luck! Feel free to open an issue if you find any problem or have any questions.
